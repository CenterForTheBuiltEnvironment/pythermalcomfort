# Summary
A set of new plotting utilities for visualizing comfort and risk regions is available under pythermalcomfort.plots (branch: `plots/first_attempt`).
These provide reusable plotters such as `plot_t_rh`, `plot_t_vr`, and a `psychrometric` helper.
The functions return Matplotlib Axes and artists so plots are composable and customizable.
It is a long message but I would really appreciate if you could read it and provide feedback, if possible answering the questions below.

# Example

Simple example of a temperature vs relative humidity plot using the PMV/PPD model from ISO 7730 standard.
More examples and customization options are provided below.
```python
    from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso

    ax, _ = plot_t_rh(
        model_func=pmv_ppd_iso,
        fixed_params={"tr": 30, "met": 1.2, "clo": 0.5, "vr": 0.1, "wme": 0.0},
        thresholds=[-0.5, 0.5],
        t_range=(10, 36),
        rh_range=(0, 100),
    )
    plt.show()
```

# Philosophy & Approach
1. Generic, reusable functions: core helpers like plot_threshold_region accept a model function and thresholds so they are model-agnostic.
2. Minimal formatting, maximum customization: functions return axes + artists; users can compose and tweak.
3. Consistent API across plotters: same param names for model_func, fixed_params, thresholds, plot_kwargs.
4. Colormap consistency: band rendering and small summary bars share the same colormap sampling. Use the Matplotlib 3.7+ API (matplotlib.colormaps["Name"].resampled(n)) to avoid deprecation.
5. Separation of concerns: computation and plotting are separated to ease testing and reuse.

# Questions

If possible I would really appreciate if each of you who are reading this could answer in a separate comments all the following questions using numbering for clarity:
1. Is the API (functions) clear and easy to use? Any suggestions for improvement?
2. API: keep per-axis plotters (plot_t_rh) or move to one flexible plot_axes(x_var, y_var, model_func, ...)?
3. Are the plots visually appealing and informative? Any suggestions for improving aesthetics or clarity?
4. Are there any additional plot types or features that would be useful to include? Aside from the ones already implemented (t_rh, t_vr, psychrometric chart). I can add the adaptive comfort models as well, which is very simple to do.
5. Shall we add the plotting functions that are available in `Clima`? Those are different from the ones implemented here since focus more on time series and external weather data rather than plotting comfort zones calculated from a model.
6. How should we name the plotting functions? Currently they are named based on the x and y axes (e.g., plot_t_rh, plot_t_vr, plot_psychrometric). Is this clear or would you suggest a different naming convention?
7. Should be the plotting functions be in a separate module (e.g., pythermalcomfort.plots) as I have done here?
8. Documentation: add a dedicated plots gallery in docs or keep README + discussion examples?
9. Do you know how we could add tests for the plotting functions? I am not sure how to do that.
10. Any other feedback or suggestions?

# How to review / reproduce
1. Check out the `plot/first_attempt` branch in the `pythermalcomfort` repo.
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements-dev.txt`
3. To run examples locally: open the example scripts in pythermalcomfort/plots and run them in an environment with Matplotlib installed.

# Examples

## Customisation
Change colorbar, line color, set different x axis limits.
```python
    ax, _ = plot_t_rh(
        ...
        plot_kwargs={"cmap": "viridis", "band_alpha": 0.3, "line_color": "k"}, # we can modify the plot style
    )
    ax.set(xlim=(10, 36), ylim=(0, 100)).   # we can modify the axes
    plt.savefig(path_download/ "t_rh_custom.png", dpi=300)
    plt.show()
```

## Full customisation

You can find the code in `pythermalcomfort\plots\t_rh.py` which I wrote to generate the following figure.
