    """Scale wind speed from the reference height to a user specified height using the
    logarithmic wind profile based on surface roughness length [Oke1987]_.

    The logarithmic wind profile is a semi-empirical relationship that describes how
    wind speed changes with height above the ground in the surface layer of the
    atmosphere. This equation assumes neutral atmospheric stability and is valid for
    heights typically ranging from a few meters to about 100 meters above the ground.
    It is commonly used in meteorology, wind engineering, and environmental
    studies to estimate wind speeds at different heights based on a known reference
    height. The formula is given by:

    .. math::
        v(h) = v_{ref} \\times \\frac{\\ln((h - d)/z0)}{\\ln((h_{ref} - d)/z0)}

    where:

    - :math:`v(h)` is the wind speed at height :math:`h`
    - :math:`v_{ref}` is the wind speed at the reference height :math:`h_{ref}` (commonly 10 m)
    - :math:`h` is the height at which the wind speed is to be estimated
    - :math:`h_{ref}` is the reference height (10 m)
    - :math:`z0` is the surface roughness length, which characterizes the roughness of the terrain
    - :math:`d` is the zero-plane displacement height, which accounts for flow obstruction by vegetation or buildings

    .. note::
        This function assumes neutral atmospheric stability conditions. For
        non-neutral conditions, more complex models such as the Monin-Obukhov
        similarity theory should be used.
        Moreover, this function does not account for obstacles or complex terrain
        effects which may require computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or
        measurements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v_z1 : float or list of floats
        Wind speed at the reference height z1 (default 10 m), [m/s]
    z2 : float or list of floats
        Height at which wind speed needs to be scaled, [m]
    z1 : float or list of floats, optional
        Reference height, [m]. Default is 10.0 m.
    z0 : float or list of floats, optional
        Surface roughness length, [m]. Default is 0.01 (open terrain). This value accounts
        for the roughness of the terrain and varies based on land use source [Sharples2023]_:

        - 0.005 m: Inland waterbodies (lakes, dams)
        - 0.03 m: Irrigated Pasture (e.g., grassland, alfalfa)
        - 0.1 m: Irrigated cropping (e.g., wheat, soybeans)
        - 0.25 m: Irrigated Sugar (e.g., sugarcane, corn)
        - 0.4 m: Towns, villages, agricultural land with many or high hedges, forests and very rough and uneven terrain
        - 0.6 m: Large towns with tall buildings
        - 1.0 m: Urban areas
        - 1.6 m: Large cities with very tall buildings

    d : float or list of floats, optional
        Zero-plane displacement height, [m]. Default is 0.0 (no displacement).
        This value accounts for the height at which the wind speed effectively becomes
        zero due to obstacles like trees or buildings. Based on [Sharples2023]_:

        - 0.0 m: Inland waterbodies (lakes, dams)
        - 0.0 m: Irrigated Pasture (e.g., grassland, alfalfa)
        - 0.5 m: Irrigated cropping (e.g., wheat, soybeans)
        - 0.5 m: Irrigated Sugar (e.g., sugarcane, corn)
        - 0.5 m: Urban areas

    round_output : bool, optional
        If True, rounds output value. If False, it does not round it. Defaults to True.

    Returns
    -------
    ScaleWindSpeedLog
        Dataclass with attribute ``v_z2`` containing the scaled wind speed(s)
        at the target height z2, [m/s].

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If input parameters are not of valid numeric types
    ValueError
        If any parameter values violate physical constraints
