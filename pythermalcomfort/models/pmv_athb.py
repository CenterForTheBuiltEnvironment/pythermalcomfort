    """Return the PMV value calculated with the Adaptive Thermal Heat Balance
    Framework [schweiker22]_. The adaptive thermal heat balance (ATHB) framework
    introduced a method to account for the three adaptive principals, namely
    physiological, behavioral, and psychological adaptation, individually
    within existing heat balance models. The objective is a predictive model of
    thermal sensation applicable during the design stage or in international
    standards without knowing characteristics of future occupants.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tdb : float or list of floats
        Dry bulb air temperature, in [°C].
    tr : float or list of floats
        Mean radiant temperature, in [°C].
    vr : float or list of floats
        Relative air speed, in [m/s].

        .. note::
            vr is the relative air speed caused by body movement and not the air
            speed measured by the air speed sensor. The relative air speed is the sum of the
            average air speed measured by the sensor plus the activity-generated air speed
            (Vag). Where Vag is the activity-generated air speed caused by motion of
            individual body parts. vr can be calculated using the function
            :py:meth:`pythermalcomfort.utilities.v_relative`.

    rh : float or list of floats
        Relative humidity, [%].
    met : float or list of floats
        Metabolic rate, [met].
    clo : bool, float or list of floats, optional
        Clothing insulation, in [clo]. If `clo` is set to False, the clothing insulation
        value will be calculated using the equation provided in the paper. Defaults to False.
    t_running_mean: float or list of floats
        Running mean temperature, in [°C].

        .. note::
            The running mean temperature can be calculated using the function
            :py:meth:`pythermalcomfort.utilities.running_mean_outdoor_temperature`.

    Returns
    -------
    ATHBResults
        Dataclass containing the results of the ATHB calculation. See :py:class:`~pythermalcomfort.classes_return.ATHBResults` for more details.
