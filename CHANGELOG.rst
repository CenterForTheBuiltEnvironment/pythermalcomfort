3.0.0 (2024-03-18)
-------------------

.. warning::
    pythermalcomfort version 3.0.0 introduces some breaking changes.

    **How functions return results:**
    as the functions now return dataclass instances with the calculation results.
    This change enhances the structure and accessibility of the results.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso
        result = pmv_ppd_iso(tdb=[22, 25], tr=25, vr=0.1, rh=50, met=1.4, clo=0.5, model='7730-2005')
        print(result.pmv)  # [-0.  0.41]

    This update aims to make the package more user-friendly and to provide a more organized way to access all calculation results.

    **Moved functions**
    Moved all the functions that were in the `psychrometrics.py` file to the `utilities.py` file.

    **Changed function names**
    All the PMV functions have been renamed using the following format: `pmv_XXX` where XXX is the standard or the model name.

    **PMV function**
    The pmv_ppd function now has been split into two functions: pmv_ppd_iso and pmv_ppd_ashrae.

.. note::
    We have updated all functions to accept Numpy arrays as inputs, allowing you to pass multiple values at once for faster results.
    Single values are still accepted, and the functions will return results as before.
    Additionally, we have synchronized the tests with the R comf package to ensure consistent calculation results across both packages.

    Other improvements include:

    * Enhanced documentation with more examples.
    * Better described the models.
    * Added more tests to ensure calculation accuracy.
    * Implemented input validation to ensure inputs are within model applicability limits.
    * Harmonized input names across all functions.
    * Added surveys to assess thermal comfort to the documentation.
    * Added a detailed section about clothing insulation.

2.0.0 (2022-04-07)
-------------------

.. warning::
    Version 2.0.0 introduces some breaking changes. Now the default behaviour of most of the function is that they return a ``np.nan`` if the inputs are outside the model applicability limits.

    For most functions we are no longer printing ``Warnings``. If you want the function to return a value even if your inputs are outside the model applicability limits then you can set the variable ``limit_input = False``. Please note that you should refrain from doing this.


.. note::
    Starting from Version 2.0.0 of pythermalcomfort now most of the functions (see detailed list below) accept Numpy arrays or lists as inputs. This allows you to write more concise and faster code since we optimized vectorization, where possible using Numba.
