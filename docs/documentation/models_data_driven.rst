Data-Driven Models
==================

These models use data driven methods such as machine learning to predict physiological variables and more as a function of both environmental and personal parameters.
Each model is accompanied by detailed descriptions, usage examples, and references to relevant standards and research.
This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to use these models to evaluate thermal comfort in various scenarios.
Please note that models are shown in alphabetical order and are not sorted based on their accuracy.
