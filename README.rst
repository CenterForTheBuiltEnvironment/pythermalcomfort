Installation
============

Install ``pythermalcomfort`` via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pythermalcomfort

For advanced installation options, refer to the `Installation Instructions <https://pythermalcomfort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.

Quick Start
===========

Get started with ``pythermalcomfort`` in just a few lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

   from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso, utci

   # Calculate PMV and PPD using ISO 7730 standard
   result = pmv_ppd_iso(
       tdb=25,  # Dry Bulb Temperature in °C
       tr=25,  # Mean Radiant Temperature in °C
       vr=0.1,  # Relative air speed in m/s
       rh=50,  # Relative Humidity in %
       met=1.4,  # Metabolic rate in met
       clo=0.5,  # Clothing insulation in clo
       model="7730-2005"  # Year of the ISO standard
   )
   print(f"PMV: {result.pmv}, PPD: {result.ppd}")

   # Calculate UTCI for heat stress assessment
   utci_value = utci(tdb=30, tr=30, v=0.5, rh=50)
   print(utci_value)

For more examples and detailed usage, check out models and indices in the models section of the documentation.
