# -------------------------------------------
# This model is often used with a thermal physiology model.
# However, this function can be used when you have physiological data and wants to use Zhang's comfort model.
# For example, this function can be used when you want to predict thermal sensation or comfort
# but you only have skin temperature or core temperature data measured by a subject experiment
# or when you have skin temperature data from a thermal manikin".
#
# If you have a time series of skin temperature data, calculate and enter the time derivative of skin temperature.
# If you want to do a steady state simulation, change 0 to it.
# The time derivative of core temperature is set to be 0 because it does change due to human thermoregulation
# except in an extremely hot or cold environment.
